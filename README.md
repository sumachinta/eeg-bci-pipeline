This repository contains a reproducible pipeline for analyzing the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset from PhysioNet.
The project demonstrates end-to-end EEG signal processing and classification for brainâ€“computer interface (BCI) tasks.

Dataset: https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/
This data set consists of over 1500 one- and two-minute EEG recordings, obtained from 109 volunteers.
